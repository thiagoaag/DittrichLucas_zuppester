# zuppester
Technical evaluation for test engineer candidates for Zup.

The team of testers at startup **zuppester** is inviting you to join a squad to build a new suite of tests, to evaluate the best Git repository manager.

The repository manager being tested by the team, is [**Github**](https://github.com/). As a test engineer, you are responsible for designing and implementing the suite of tests to verify some functions of [**Github**].

You can use any programming language, framework and tool to create the suite of automated tests.


## Instructions:
All test scenarios must be run on this repository, and you should user your GitHub account. 

All test cases should validate scenarios of success and failures. 

Should be created *automated tests* for:
- Screen test: https://github.com, execute with some automated testing framework to validate web applications
- Rest API : https://developer.github.com/v3/, executed with some command line tool


##### Requirements for _Screen test_:
- login
- create a branch
- list branches
- create and commit a file at new branch

##### Requirements for _REST API_:
- login
- create a release
- list releases
- delete release

## What will be evaluated:
- Adherence to requirements
- Elegance of the solution
- Documentation
- Defense of the solution through presentation
- The source code must be in this Git repository
- You will have up to 7 days to resolve this test
- It should contain a file named README.md describing the solution and how to test and run the project

Good luck!
